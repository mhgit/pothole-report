  high-risk: "This defect is located in the primary line of travel for cyclists. Due to its depth, it presents a significant risk of ejection. It is currently forcing cyclists to swerve into the path of motor traffic to avoid it. Please treat as an urgent safety hazard."
  hidden: "This pothole is often obscured by shadows or standing water, making it invisible to cyclists until impact. As it sits directly where a rider is expected to be, it represents a high risk of a serious incident."
