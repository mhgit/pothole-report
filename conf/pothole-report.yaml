# Road Defect Risk Matrix for Cyclists (UK Council Reporting)
# Prepared by: Cycling Road Safety Expert
# Focus: Triggering Council "Section 58" statutory defense awareness and risk-based prioritization.

risk_levels:
  level_1_emergency:
    description: "An immediate threat to life and limb. Usually a defect deeper than 50mm with sharp, vertical 'shear' edges, located in a high-speed descent, a braking zone, or a primary cycle line."
    visual_indicators: "Deep 'crater' style hole, often with exposed sub-base (rubble/dirt). Sharp edges capable of instant tyre deflation or rim destruction. Positioned where a cyclist cannot safely avoid it without darting into fast-moving motor traffic."
    report_template: >
      EMERGENCY: Immediate safety hazard to vulnerable road users. This defect exceeds the 50mm intervention 
      level and is located in the primary line of travel on a [descent/junction]. It presents a critical 
      risk of rider ejection and catastrophic wheel failure. Cyclists are currently forced to swerve 
      unpredictably into the path of motor traffic to avoid personal injury. Please attend within 
      24 hours to mitigate the risk of a serious personal injury claim.

  level_2_high_priority:
    description: "A significant hazard that meets or exceeds standard intervention levels (40mm). Often obscured or positioned such that it compromises the safety of the road layout."
    visual_indicators: "A deep pothole (approx. the depth of a fist) that may be frequently filled with standing water or hidden by shadows/overhanging trees. It is situated where a cyclist is expected to be (the nearside or primary position)."
    report_template: >
      HIGH RISK: Significant road defect meeting statutory intervention levels. This defect is a 'hidden 
      hazard' as it is frequently obscured by [standing water/shadows], making it invisible until impact. 
      Located in the primary line of travel, it creates a high probability of loss of control for cyclists. 
      Under the Highways Act 1980, this constitutes a failure to maintain the highway in a safe condition 
      for all users. Urgent repair is requested to prevent a high-speed incident.

  level_3_medium_hazard:
    description: "Developing defects or 'clusters' of smaller holes that together create a hazardous surface. These often sit just below the 40mm threshold but are dangerous due to their frequency."
    visual_indicators: "Multiple smaller potholes (crazing/alligator cracking) grouped together. The surface is breaking up, creating loose 'marbles' of gravel. Often found on the approach to roundabouts or junctions where braking occurs."
    report_template: >
      HAZARDOUS SURFACE: Multiple progressing defects creating a 'skid hazard' for two-wheeled vehicles. 
      While individual holes may be sub-intervention, the aggregate effect and presence of loose 
      detritus (surface fretting) significantly compromise braking and steering stability. As this is 
      a [junction approach/bend], the risk of a cyclist losing traction is high. Requesting 
      preventative resurfacing to avoid a full structural failure and subsequent injury.

  level_4_developing_risk:
    description: "Defects that are currently navigable but are deteriorating rapidly due to weather or traffic volume. These represent a future liability."
    visual_indicators: "Sunken ironworks (manhole covers) or longitudinal cracking (cracks running parallel to the direction of travel) which can 'trap' a thin bicycle tyre."
    report_template: >
      SAFETY CONCERN: Longitudinal cracking and sunken utility cover. This defect presents a 'tramlining' 
      risk, where bicycle tyres can become trapped, leading to a fall. It is currently forcing 
      hazardous road positioning. Though the depth is currently borderline, the rate of 
      deterioration suggests a breach of safety standards is imminent. Early intervention is 
      advised to maintain the integrity of the cycle route and minimize long-term repair costs.

  level_5_monitoring_nuisance:
    description: "Minor surface degradation that affects comfort and increases wear and tear, but does not yet present an immediate risk of a fall."
    visual_indicators: "Early-stage 'fretting' (loss of the top stone layer), minor hairline cracks, or uneven patching from previous repairs."
    report_template: >
      MAINTENANCE REQUEST: Early-stage surface failure. The road surface is showing signs of 
      significant fretting and water ingress. To prevent the development of high-risk potholes 
      during the next freeze-thaw cycle, this section requires preventative maintenance. 
      Addressing this now aligns with a 'Right First Time' policy and avoids the higher costs 
      associated with emergency reactive repairs and potential insurance claims.

  key_phrases:
    - "Primary line of travel"
    - "Risk of ejection"
    - "Vulnerable road user"
    - "Statutory intervention level"
    - "Highways Act 1980 Section 58"
    - "Loss of control"
  pro_tip: "Always include a photo with a common object (like a water bottle or 50p coin) for scale. If the hole is deep, a ruler showing it exceeds 40mm is the 'golden ticket' for council action."
