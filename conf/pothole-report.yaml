    gt50mm: "exceeds 50mm (emergency intervention level)"
  edge_description:

    general: "on a general route"
  visibility_description:
    obscured_water: "frequently obscured by standing water, making it invisible until impact"
    obscured_shadows: "often hidden by shadows or overhanging trees"
    visible: "clearly visible"
  surface_description:
    exposed_sub_base: "Exposed sub-base (rubble/dirt visible) indicates significant structural failure"
    loose_gravel: "Loose gravel and surface fretting create a skid hazard for two-wheeled vehicles"
    longitudinal_crack: "Longitudinal cracking presents a 'tramlining' risk where bicycle tyres can become trapped"
    hairline: "Hairline cracks and early-stage fretting indicate water ingress and future structural failure"

advice_for_reporters:
  key_phrases:
    - "Primary line of travel"
    - "Risk of ejection"
    - "Vulnerable road user"
    - "Statutory intervention level"
    - "Highways Act 1980 Section 58"
    - "Loss of control"
  pro_tip: "Always include a photo with a common object (like a water bottle or 50p coin) for scale. If the hole is deep, a ruler showing it exceeds 40mm is the 'golden ticket' for council action."
